* ==> The challenge:- this challenge was given by the frontend mentor .
     1. This is a calculator app which allows user to do some calculation like add, subtract, multiply and devide.
     2. User can select the color theme according to his choice .

*==>My process:- I took the desktop first approach and wrote HTML and CSS first for setting the design/UI. then I wrote js for use cases of calculator and theme.

*==> Build with:- 
   1. Semantic HTML5 markup
   2. CSS custom properties
   3. Flexbox
   4. CSS Grid
   5. Mobile-first workflow
   6. JavaScript 

*==> Useful resources
   * Stack overflow - This helped me recall some array methods that were a litle bit blurry in memory.
   * Google - and ofcourse, dear old google. Had a lot to research on this project, things like, array methods, programming paradigms and so on.
